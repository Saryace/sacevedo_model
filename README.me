### SS4GG hackathon: NIR soil spectroscopy modelling
ML challenge of predicting soil organic carbon with a handheld near-infrared (NIR) NeoSpectra device and open geo data/covariates

* This is my first time trying to fit a model using this type of data. 
* The packages tidymodels, prospectr and corrr were the main packages used in the model development.
* Before submitting, I tried random forest and boosting, but always cubist performed better. 
* I had to install git lfs for versioning large files
